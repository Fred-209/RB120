Now that we have a Walkable module, we are given a new challenge. Apparently some of our users
 are nobility, and the regular way of walking simply isn't good enough. Nobility need to strut.

We need a new class Noble that shows the title and name when walk is called:

byron = Noble.new("Byron", "Lord")
p byron.walk
# => "Lord Byron struts forward"

We must have access to both name and title because they are needed for other p
urposes that we aren't showing here.

byron.name
=> "Byron"
byron.title
=> "Lord"

=end

=begin
You have the following classes.

class Person
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end

You need to modify the code so that this works:

mike = Person.new("Mike")
mike.walk
# => "Mike strolls forward"

kitty = Cat.new("Kitty")
kitty.walk
# => "Kitty saunters forward"

flash = Cheetah.new("Flash")
flash.walk
# => "Flash runs forward"
=end

module Walkable
  def walk
    puts "#{name} #{gait} forwards."
  end
end

class Person
  include Walkable
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  include Walkable

  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  include Walkable

  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end

class Noble
  attr_reader :name, :title

  def initialize(name, title)
    @name = name
    @title = title
  end

  def walk
    "#{title} #{name} #{gait} forward"
  end

  private

  def gait
    'struts'
  end
end

mike = Person.new("Mike")
mike.walk
# => "Mike strolls forward"

kitty = Cat.new("Kitty")
kitty.walk
# => "Kitty saunters forward"

flash = Cheetah.new("Flash")
flash.walk
# => "Flash runs forward"

byron = Noble.new("Byron", "Lord")
p byron.walk
# => "Lord Byron struts forward"

p byron.name
# => "Byron"
p byron.title
# => "Lord"
