  Welcome to Twenty One!!

  If you're not familiar with this game (Blackjack), the rules are simple. 
  You will be playing against the Dealer (computer AI).
  A traditional deck of 52 cards is shuffled, and you and the dealer are both 
  dealt 2 cards to start with. 

  The goal is to add the values of your cards up to get as close to 21 as possible
  without going over. If you go over, you're BUSTED! and lose the game. 

  Jack's, Queen's and King's are worth 10, while an Ace is worth 1 or 11, depending
  on your need at the time.
  If you have multiple Aces you can mix up their values between 1 and 11 to get 
  you as close to 21 as possible without going over.
